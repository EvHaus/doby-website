<h2><span class="pref">grid.</span>destroy()</h2>
<p>Cleanly destroy the grid instance, removing any event bindings and references. You will want to call this method to free up any memory used by the grid.</p>

<p>If you have the <a href="#grid-options-autoDestroy"><code class="pill">options.autoDestroy</code></a> option enabled, you do not need to manually call this method as it will be automatically called when your grid is removed from the DOM.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">new DobyGrid(...).destroy();</code></pre>
